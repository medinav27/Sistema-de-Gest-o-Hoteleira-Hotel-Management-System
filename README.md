# Hotel Management System – Java Full Stack

## Overview
A modular Hotel Management System built with **Java** applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project simulates real hotel operations including reservation management, client check-in/out, room availability tracking, and business logic organisation.

Designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate practical application of Java, data structures, exception handling, and architectural design.
